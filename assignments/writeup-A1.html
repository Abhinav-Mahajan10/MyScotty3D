(##) A1T1 CHECKPOINT

(##) A1T2 CHECKPOINT

</div>
Spent a day on this task, was struggling initially with the diamond exit rule.

(##) A1T3 CHECKPOINT

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/student/task3-flat-triangles.png" alt="Rasterize flat cubes">
</div>
It was easier to implement, all the important clues were given in the instructions above the function. took ~1.5 hours for implementing this. and 1.5 more for clipping.

(##) A1T4 CHECKPOINT

* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see three colors?
    * Red: Blend: Replace, Depth: Less
    * Green: Blend: Replace, Depth: Less
    * Blue: Blend: Replace, Depth: Less
* What combination of blend and depth styles would enable us to see five colors?
    * Red: Blend: Add, Depth: Always
    * Green: Blend: Add, Depth: Always
    * Blue: Blend: Add, Depth: Always

Three colors: Replace + Depth Less means only the closest object at each pixel is visible and completely overwrites the color. 
Five colors: Add + Depth Always means all objects render regardless of depth and their colors add together. You see the three primary colors plus blended colors where cubes overlap


(##) GenAI Use CHECKPOINT

Which model(s) did you use (e.g., ChatGPT-4, Claude-2, etc.)?
Claude 4.5 Sonnet-Extended Thinking

For what purpose(s) did you use GenAI (e.g., brainstorming, code generation, debugging, etc.)?
I used it for task 2, i needed a new theoretical understanding of the diamond exit rule to implement it. 

What was it good at? What was it bad at?
It was great at it. my prompt was, "Explain the diamond exit rule with examples, especially how its used to remove skipping+duplicate counting."

(##) A1T5 FINAL

Reference image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task5-smooth-correct-triangles.png" alt="Rasterize smooth and correct cubes">
</div>
Please replace the above image with your own screenshot of the rasterized smooth and correct triangles cubes.
This can be done by doing the following:
* Open `media/js3d/A1-cubes.js3d` in the GUI, 
* Set the DrawStyle of the wireframe cube to be 'smooth' and the DrawStyle of the flat cube to be 'correct', 
* Click on the Render tab, then open the Render Window, and use the default settings to rasterize the scene. You will need to switch from the `Path Tracer` option to `Software Rasterizer` option.

Your completion will be graded based on the above picture, the reference `test.a1.task5.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing flat triangle meshes will look decent.

(##) A1T6 FINAL

You do not need any screenshots for this task. 

Your completion will be graded based on the reference `test.a1.task6.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing the samplers scene will look decent.

(##) A1T7 FINAL

Insert a picture of your sample pattern here (up to you on how you created it):
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/task7-sample-pattern.png" alt="Sample pattern">
</div>

Explanation of what your SamplePattern does and scenarios it would do well and poorly in:

Your completion will be graded based on the above answer, the reference `test.a1.task7.cpp` file and 
checking that rasterizing the samplers scene will look decent.

(##) RASTERIZED IMAGE FINAL

Your image:
<div class="twentytwenty-container">
    <img src="A1-writeup/reference/rasterize_image.png" alt="Your creation">
</div>
Explanation of what it is and how you made it:

Any free model sources you need to credit?

Which model(s) did you use (e.g., ChatGPT-4, Claude-2, etc.)?

For what purpose(s) did you use GenAI (e.g., brainstorming, code generation, debugging, etc.)?

What was it good at? What was it bad at?
